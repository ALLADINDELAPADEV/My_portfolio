    <p>My <i>favorite</i> thing about programming is the challanges that it provides. This is entirely new to me so it's a big challange to commit and put into action. 
    I am older so the brain does not work as quickly or as sharp as it use to. But I will make the effort becuase I am determined to follow my own path</p>
   

    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p><a href="https://hipsum.com">Lorem ipsum</a> or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The
    passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De
    Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:
    
    “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
    aliqua.”
    The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't
    distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very
    useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.
    
    The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and
    again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on
    templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of
    lorem ipsum.
